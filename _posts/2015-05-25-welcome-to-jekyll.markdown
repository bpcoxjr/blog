Welcome!  You've stumbled upon the first post here at display: blog.  I'm happy to have you join me.  My name is Patrick Cox, and I'm a front-end web developer based in Durham, North Carolina.  Nearly two years into my career as a developer, I decided to start this blog because I believe it will help me continue to learn as much as possible about the fast-paced, ever-changing ecosystem that is front-end development.

I recently discovered that I learn best through helping to teach others, so you can expect to regularly find tutorials here on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Additionally, I plan to post a weekly round-up of helpful or just plain cool stuff I find that I think others could benefit from reading.

To learn a little bit more about myself and the blog, start [here](https://www.displayblog.io/about)

Let's get started!

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">Welcome to another edition of the weekly roundup!</span>

It's been a hectic week for me, as evidenced by the lack of a tutorial post this week.  I'm actively hunting for a new full-time role, and that's taken up a lot of my free time that would otherwise be spent publishing posts on this site.  But don't worry, I have a post for next week planned on my most frequently used JavaScript array methods, and how you can harness their powers to be used in your own projects.

As always, I read some cool stuff this week, and bookmarked it all to share here with you.  Here's the five best web-development- related things I read this week...

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">1.</span>  Speaking of looking for a new role, I found a really motivating piece written by a junior JS developer who quit his full-time job, traveled around China for a few months and committed to learning full-stack development, and doubled his salary in a new role upon returning to the United States.  While I recognize this approach is not feasible for everyone, or maybe almost no one, it worked for him, and the article is inspiring for those among us always looking to better ourselves and further our careers.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">2.</span>  Static sites seem to be all the rage these days.  There are many tools available to build static sites (this site is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)), and there are new ones popping up all the time it seems (see [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)).  Static sites are, as their name implies, static, meaning the content stays the same.  Sure, there may be animation and responsiveness, but that's about it.  If you maintain static sites, or are looking to build one or many, I recommend this piece that offers a lot of cool tips on how to set them up to run blazingly fast!

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">3.</span>  Bootstrap version 4 is out.  What's new?  What's been deprecated, and what's been tweaked?  Learn the key features in five minutes flat.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">4.</span>  I found this tutorial rather fascinating.  One developer shows how to build a rotating globe of the earth using JavaScript's canvas API, and explains the challenges the task presented, and how they were overcome.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">5.</span>  Facebook has been in the news a lot lately, and not for anything good.  We recently learned of the firm Cambridge Analytica, which used Facebook users' own data against them, weaponizing it to manipulate the 2016 election.  I read recently that if we actually took the time to read all the terms and conditions we agree too over the course of a calendar year, it would take 76 days.  Let's be honest, we're not reading any of that stuff, even though we say we care about our privacy.  We're just checking boxes and clicking buttons in an effort to get through the mind-numbing legalese as quickly as possible.  In this piece, author Dave Pell argues one simple idea: never share anything on the internet unless you are willing to accept that one day it may become public.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">I'm back again with another weekly roundup.</span>

I hope everyone had a good week, and that you read this week's post on my three most used JavaScript array methods.  As always, I saved the coolest things I read this week in the world of web development so that I could share them here with you.  Here are the five best things I read this week...

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">1.</span>  As I mentioned last week, Bootstrap v4 is out, and there are a lot of changes.  Thankfully, this week I discovered a free course that will bring you up to speed on all the changes.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">2.</span>  Okay, so this one is a video, not an article, but I'm sharing it because it's really interesting and informative.  In this presentation, Joe Cocco, Engineering Manager at San Francisco based DocuSign, provides a thorough look at what it was like for the company to migrate their codebase over to ReactJS.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">3.</span>  We cue up Netflix with just a click or two of our remotes, shuffle through endless possibilities, choose one, click our remotes once more, and the stream instantly starts.  It's so easy and seems so magical.  But what happens on the other end of the endless miles of fiber optic cable that makes it all work so seamlessly?

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">4.</span>  In the front-end world, things change extremely quickly.  Sometimes it seems like there are no frameworks and libraries emerging on a daily basis.  Here's an overview of where things currently stand in the JavaScript ecosystem.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">5.</span>  Really want to throw on your headphones and be productive, but don't want the music to be too distracting?  The folks over at freeCodeCamp have set up a 24/7 livestream on Youtube of music that is the perfect background noise to you coding sessions.

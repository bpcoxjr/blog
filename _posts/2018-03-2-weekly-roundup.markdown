<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">Welcome once again to the weekly roundup!</span>

Happy Friday! I hope your week has gone well. As usual, I've done a lot of reading and learning this week, and saved some links to the best things I came across so that I can share them with you. Check them out in your free time this weekend!

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">1.</span> My four-part series on CSS grid was enough to make you dangerous. If you're ready to take that a step farther (like I am), here's ten cool examples of cool things people have done with the technology. Best of all, they're in CodePen, so you can play around with them!

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">2.</span> It seems with each new day there's a new technology emerging that's supposed to make our jobs as developers easier, but often results in the opposite. Yes, we have more power at our fingertips and can therefore achieve more, but at a cost of greater complexity. Chris Coyier, founder of CSS-Tricks, opines about what it all means in this esssay.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">3.</span> As developers, we've probably all used CSS resets in our CSS files before. They're the snippets that attempt to neutralize the styles imposed by each individual flavor of browser in an attempt to make our applications render the way we intend them to across all platforms. One of the most popular of those the past few years has been Normalize. Now Sindre Sorhus, an open source developer, has sought to improve on that, by releasing modern-normalize.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">4.</span> One of the most painful things about being a web developer is getting our development environment properly set up. What if I told you a powerful Mac web development environment can be yours with a single terminal command? Check out laptop, from Thoughtbot:

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">5.</span> Getting your first job as a junior-level developer can be daunting, and even seem impossible at times. There are tons of development job postings all over the internet, but very few for junior devs. What does it mean? At Medium, Melissa McEwen explains why it's a sign the industry is broken.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">It's weekly roundup time again!</span>

Thanks for joining me this week.  It's been a busy week on my end once again, hence the lack of a tutorial post.  I've got a post on Webpack in the works, sitting in my drafts folder.  I hope to have it up for your enjoyment and learning purposes next week!

Let's cut to the chase!  Here are five cool things I read this week that I think are worth your time!

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">1.</span>  First up is a post on Node.js that I found really helpful.  If you do any sifting through front-end development job posts, you've probably seen Node.js mentioned as a skill requirement, or perhaps it's listed under "nice to have".  Prior to reading this article and starting to play around with it, my only knowledge of Node.js was a familiarity and frequent usage of its package ecosystem, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com).  That might be your only exposure as well.  If so, this introductory article is well worth your time!

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">2.</span>  You may recall a few recent links I posted about the newest version of Bootstrap, version 4.  If you're tired of calling on Bootstrap when quick prototyping your projects, there are new options emerging all the time.  One I've been experimenting with lately is Bulma.  It's extremely lightweight, and just as useful as Bootstrap.  Try it out!

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">3.</span>  While we're talking about design, here's a long-form piece that makes the argument human psychology should be taken into account when designing web applications.  I'll definitely be more mindful of it going forward having read this piece, and I'm sure you will too.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">4.</span>  Of course, what good are beautifully designed websites if they're slow to load?  I saw a statistic recently that said nearly half of internet users expect a webpage to load in around two seconds, and most will abandon a site altogether if it takes longer than three seconds to load.  This is of course assuming a high speed connection is present.  If your sites are loading slowly, you may want to consider lazy loading your images and videos.  Here's a very thorough tutorial from Google on how to do just that.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">5.</span>  As I've mentioned many times before, the world of front-end development is always changing, and with that rapid change often comes stress and anxiety for us developers.  As soon as you learn the hot new JS framework to level up your skillset and remain competitive in the job marketplace, it seems like a new one pops up the very next day and all of a sudden all the cool kids are using it and your company wants to use it, and OH MY GOD I have no idea what I'm doing.  We've all been there.  Take a deep breath.  Once your heart rate returns to normal, read this...

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">Thanks for joining me again for the weekly roundup!</span>

It's been another hectic week, and unfortunately for the second week in a row I haven't had time to write a tutorial post, but I hope to change that this week.  I did, however, as always, save a few cool things I read to share with you here, my thinking being you might find them useful and/or interesting.

Without further delay...

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">1.</span>  It's been about three years since I dove headfirst into the world of web development, specifically front-end development.  And in that relatively short amount of time, things have evolved and changed drastically.  It sometimes feels as if there is a new build tool or JavaScript framework emerging almost weekly.  My best friend works in back-end development, and comparatively refers to front-end as the "wild, wild west."  I think there's some truth to that statement.  Here's an <strong>outstanding</strong> piece I found this week that flowcharts the path to learning modern front-end development.  Try not to be overwhelmed.  Seriously.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">2.</span>  Speaking of build tools, [Webpack](https://www.webpack.js.org) has quickly become the de facto build tool/module bundler of choice for many.  Personally, I use it sometimes, but have historically found it to be a bit too complex for my needs in most cases.  That said, Webpack 4 has simplified things substantially.  If you've been using Grunt or Gulp for a while, consider giving Webpack a look.  Here's a good read/tutorial on how to get up and running in a hurry.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">3.</span>  Fair warning: This blog post I stumbled upon is excellent - I mean, <strong>really</strong> excellent - but it's also extremely long.  But I promise it is worth your time.  I'll only preface the piece by saying this: consider everyone else when building for the web.  Don't be selfish as a developer.  Simply put, it's not about you!

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">4.</span>  This is the fun widget of the week!  It's an easily customizable tool that allows you to create animated confetti for your web projects.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">5.</span>  We all use various technological devices, websites, apps, etc. on a daily basis.  This extremely eye-opening article from Bloomberg breaks down into categories how the various tech companies dominate the hours of your day.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">It's that time of the week: time for another weekly roundup!</span>

Things have been so hectic lately, that I missed posting completely last week, but fear not, I'm back with more cool links.  I hope everyone's had a great week.  Here are five cool things I read this week...

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">1.</span>  This is an incredibly awesome resource for developers of all skill levels.  Here's 530 programming and computer science courses that are sure to keep you busy and help you learn a thing or two.  And best of all, they're all <strong>free</strong>!

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">2.</span>  This blog runs on a domain name I purchased and own.  I'm guessing you probably knew that.  But if you're like me, you've never really thought about what happens when you purchase a domain name.  Here's a really insightful piece about just that.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">3.</span>  There are quite a few CSS frameworks in the front-end world these days, and each one has their own way of laying out a grid.  Here's one with a twist, called "LayItOut!".  All you have to do is choose the number of columns and rows you want from a drop-down menu, as well as how many fractional units of space each should occupy, and once you've got it set up the way you want, just click a button and a CSS file is generated for you!  This means no link to a CSS framework in your HTML head, or no downloading it via NPM.  <strong>Awesome.</strong>

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">4.</span>  Here's a thoughtful piece in which one blogger argues that 2018 marks the end of what has become known as JavaScript Fatigue.  Why?  Because Vue/Angular/React are all component based.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">5.</span>  Here's a good article on <code>let</code> vs. <code>const</code> vs. <code>var</code>.  Spoiler alert: <code>var</code> is just about dead.

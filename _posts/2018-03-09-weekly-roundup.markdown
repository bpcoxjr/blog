<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">Happy Friday, and welcome once again to the weekly roundup!</span>

I hope everyone had a great week.  It's been a quiet one here on the blog, as I'm sure you've noticed.  Don't worry, we'll pick back up next week where we loft off with our tutorial series on CSS variables.

If you're wondering why it's been so quiet around here this week, well, I've been working on a fun new side project that I hope to go live with early next week if not by the end of this weekend.  For all readers in the triangle area of North Carolina, if you love a good cup of coffee and hanging out in fun, quirky, hidden treasure sort of cafes, you'll want to stay tuned for that!

While I didn't have time to work on a new tutorial post this week, I did bookmark a few cool things I read around the web that I thought were worth sharing with you.

Here are your five links for this week:

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">1.</span>  Much has been written in opinion pieces around the internet and in medical studies the past few years about how technology is taking over our lives, and the negative effects that can come with that.  Recently, Silicon Valley has started to admit that while their intentions are usually good, the design of their products can cause addiction.  In New York Times Magazine, author John Herrman wonders if its even possible at this point to put the lid back on Pandora's box, and if systems and software meant to turn attention into money can even be reformed.  But if they can, the tiny red dots fighting for our attention are a good place to start.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">2.</span>  Github can be an intimidating and frustrating place for beginning and intermediate developers.  This piece breaks down the basic features of the site and will have you up and running in no time.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">3.</span>  Speaking of things that can be frustrating, even the senior most developers can fall victim to the wacky behaviors of CSS.  This piece points out some of the more interesting and surprising quirks you're bound to encounter when dealing with cascading style sheets.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">4.</span>  Often when we talk about great web design we tend to overlook the importance of the colors we use. While working on my latest side project, I was searching for some color inspiration, and was in need of three or four colors I could use to style my application.  I stumbled upon Flat UI Colors and immediately booked marked it.  If you too are searching for the perfect shade for a logo, font or header, etc. you'll do well to check this site out.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">5.</span>  When we set out learning to code, we often think of the traditional ways to teach ourselves: big, thick mind-numbingly boring books, video tutorials, and code along challenges on various websites.  One think you may not have considered is podcasts.  I recently stumbled upon the Syntax podcast, which has quickly become a fun way for me to pick up new bits of knowledge.  The best way about learning this way is it can be much more fun that the other methods, and you can listen to it in small pieces when it's convenient for you - when you're in the car or on the treadmill, etc.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">Welcome to another edition of the weekly roundup!</span>

Thanks for stopping by the blog again.  Here are five cool things I read this week and saved to share with you.  I hope you find them useful!

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">1.</span>  I hope my CSS grid series a few weeks ago came in handy.  One thing we didn't really discuss was CSS grid vs Flexbox.  When should you use one over the other?  Plus, did you know you can use them together (Shameless plug: I recently used them together on my [Triangle Coffee Finder](https://www.trianglecoffeefinder.com) project)?  Here's a great piece from Hackernoon that explains some of the differences, when to use one over the other, and how to use them together.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">2.</span>  In last week's weekly roundup I linked you a piece on getting started with Git.  If you read that, feel comfortable with its concepts, and remain curious, you'll want to check this one out.  Here's five key Git concepts for you to learn <span style="font-style: italic;">the hard way</span>.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">3.</span>  No front-end JS library has risen to prominence faster than React, thanks largely in part to it being created and supported by the engineers at Facebook.  You're sure to see it in a large number of front-end web development job postings, and its growth is also reflected in recent surveys of industry professionals concerning the tools they use.  Thinking about learning React in 2018?  Tyler McGinnis' tutorial is a great place to start.  He also has a paid course on React that I have personally paid for, completed, and highly recommend.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">4.</span>  If you've been developing for any non-trivial amount of time you no doubt have countless plugins installed on your text editor of choice.  One of the most popular that I use, and I'm betting you use too, is ESLint. It's a truly great tool to hook up to a build tool like Gulp or Grunt to use at run time to find any issues with your JavaScript files, and it does a great job of reporting errors to you in a clear, concise manner.  We use numerous plugins like these all the time without giving them much thought past tweaking the settings to get them meet our needs.  But have you ever stopped and wondered who is behind their creation?  Or how they were conceived and brought to fruition?  This is the origin story of ESLint.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">5.</span>  One of the most painful things to do as a developer is to think about how to design forms, user account creation processes, or anything similar that requires taking a user through a series of steps.  It can be doubly painful for end users.  If you're anything like me, at one point or another in your time of using the internet, you've closed out of a browser window before completing the signup process for some sort of account, order process, etc. simply because it was too long, or too confusing, or too [insert pain point here].  DriverJS is here to help you solve those sorts of issues for your users, by elegantly meshing with your applications to steer the attention of your users through multi-step processes such as these.

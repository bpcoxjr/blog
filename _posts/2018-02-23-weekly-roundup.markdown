<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">Welcome to the very first weekly roundup!</span>

Happy Friday!  I hope everyone has had a great week.  It's been unseasonably warm here in North Carolina this week, so I've been trying to get out and take advantage of that as much as I can.

Here's a few things I read this week that I thought you might like to read as well...

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">1.</span>  Code is everywhere these days, playing a major role in industries that years ago, people probably thought it would never permeate.  Nowhere is it at the forefront more these days than in the automobile industry, where the battle for dominance of semi-autonomous technological features continues to wage on.  The face of the technology for the past few years has been Tesla, whose auto-pilot feature has been well-documented.  Believe it or not, General Motors is quickly closing the gap with technology they call SuperCruise.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">2.</span>  Speaking of battles, the battle for front-end framework supremacy has been going on between AngularJS and React for quite some time now.  Over at Hackernoon, one developer breaks down why he's leaving AnguarJS behind for React and Redux this year.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">3.</span>  Over at the Codepen blog, one developer waxes poetically about her love for the built-in colorpickers of both Chrome and Firefox.

<span style="font-size: 1.25em; font-weight: bold; color: #ac0863;">4.</span>  Every developer's road from beginner to employed is unique in its own way.  This developer details the rollercoaster experience that was her first year falling in love with coding.

<article class="post-item container">
  <p><span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 1.5em">display: blog</span> was created, and is maintained by me, <a href="https://www.bpcoxjr.com">B. Patrick Cox, Jr.</a>, a Durham, North Carolina-based front-end web developer.  I decided to create this blog because I have historically found that I learn best by teaching.  There's an old saying that if you can't explain something to a five-year-old, you don't really understand it, and I believe that to be true.  You can expect tutorials here to be written and explained more in layman's terms as opposed to the technical jargon you'll find in most documentation.  I was, and often times still feel like, an outsider in the world of web development.  Even the most seasoned developers still feel imposter syndrome from time to time.</p>

  <p>My goal here is to make front-end development as approachable as possible.  However, please keep in mind most of the tutorials here are not geared for the complete novice.  They assume you know at least a little bit about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  If you don't, don't give up yet.  I highly recommend you head over to <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" style="font-size: 1.5em">Codecademy</a> and start there, beginning with their easy to follow introductory courses to HTML and CSS, and then proceed to JavaScript.</p>

  <h1>How I Arrived Here</h1>
  <p>My path to arriving at a career in web development was as unconvential as one could possible imagine.  I don't have a computer science degree, but I do have a college degree...in business administration.  Before becoming a front-end developer I bounced around in all sorts of industries - from a car rental agency, to business loan officer, to customer service, to merchandising, to retail.  After an early onset mid-life crisis in 2015, I decided it was time to make a major change in my life, and decided to try my hand at web development, something I'd be genuinely curious about for many years.  I learned enough over the course of six months to be dangerous via <a style="font-size: 1.5em" href="https://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, with the assistance of a great mentor, <a style="font-size: 1.5em;" href="https://devries.jp">J.P. DeVries</a>, secured my first job in the summer of 2016, and the rest is history.</p>
